## Nav meshes

This repository contains navigation meshes that are used in the main project.

It is used as a git submodule, because it can contain large binary files which can polute git history of the main project.

The navigation mesh is held inside zip archive, because this way it's size is below 100 MB, which is the Github's limit.
